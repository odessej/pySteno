# Building off of LolnationCH/pySteno Stenography tool
### In Progress ###

I will be building a visual interface for this tool, to make it easy for everyday users to create their own secure backups hidden within images.

additional features being incorporated:
- Nesting of images within images (visual interface)
  - can have multiple images in an image via an encrypted file containing the multiple images
- More encryption options
  - abilty to use different encryption schemes (at users choice)
  - some standard types patterns / libraries will be bundled for ease of use
